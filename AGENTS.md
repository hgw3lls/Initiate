# Codex Instructions

- This project uses Vite + React.
- Prefer TypeScript for new modules; do not migrate existing JavaScript files unless required.
- Keep changes minimal and incremental.
- Always add or adjust unit tests for engine logic using Vitest.
- For UI changes, keep styling minimal while matching the 5-screen ritual flow.
- Default telemetry must remain local-only via `localStorage` with no network calls.
